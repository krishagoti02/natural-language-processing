HMMs are a type of probabilistic model that can learn the statistical relationships between words and their corresponding POS tags from annotated training data.\n",
        "* In POS tagging, the HMM model considers each word in a sentence as an observation and assigns a POS tag to each observation based on the probabilities learned from the training data. The model uses a set of hidden states to represent the possible POS tags for each observation. The HMM algorithm then calculates the probability of each hidden state sequence given the observed sequence of words, using the Viterbi algorithm. The most likely hidden state sequence is chosen as the predicted POS tags for the sentence.\n",
